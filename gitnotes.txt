Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an 
emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds 
for Linux kernel development. G


Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to 
work together and maintain a complete history of their work.

Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files 
and enables team collaboration. 

distributed version control systems:DVCS clients not only check out the latest snapshot of the directory but they 
also fully mirror the repository. If the sever goes down, then the repository from 
any client can be copied back to the server to restore it. Every checkout is a full 
backup of the repository. 


Advantages of Git:
Free and open source
Fast and small
Easier branching


Step 1: You modify a file from the working directory.
Step 2: You add these files to the staging area.
Step 3: You perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging 
area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the Git 
repository.



First commit
[bash]$ git add sort.c
# adds file to the staging area
[bash]$ git commit –m “Added sort operation”
# Second commit
[bash]$ git add search.c
# adds file to the staging area
[bash]$ git commit –m “Added search operation”

Commit :
 the current state of the repository. A commit is also named 
by SHA1 hash. You can consider a commit object as a node of the linked list. 
Every commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object.


Clone
Clone operation creates the instance of the repository. Clone operation not only 
checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete repository. Users
can perform many operations with this local repository. The only time 
networking gets involved is when the repository instances are being 
synchronized.


Pull
Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local 
one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository 
instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.


Push:
Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. 
This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository. This is 
same as the commit operation in Subversion.


add:
 some cases, you may want to change some of your existing files. In other cases, you may want to add untracked files to your repository.

In both cases, you will need to use the same Git command : Git Add.

The easiest way to add all files to your Git repository is to use the “git add” command followed by the “-A” option for “all”.

$ git add -A                       

$ git add .                        (at the root of your project folder)


The git checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository. 
$ git checkout <branchname>
